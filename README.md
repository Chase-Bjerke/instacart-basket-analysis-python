# Instacart Customer Segmentation & Sales Analysis

## Project Summary

Instacart is a leading online grocery platform seeking deeper insight into customer behavior to support targeted marketing efforts. As a data analyst for Instacart, I explored purchasing patterns across orders, products, and user demographics to help stakeholders move beyond general sales success and toward strategic segmentation.

This portfolio includes modular Jupyter notebooks and documented workflows that trace customer behavior across peak order times, product affinity, and segmentation variables like loyalty, region, and family status. While datasets are excluded per exercise requirements, all analysis steps are reproducible and structured to answer real stakeholder questions with strategic clarity.

## Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

●The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.

## Folder Overview
The repository is structured to reflect each stage of the analysis, with folders organized as follows:

● 01 Project Management:
Contains the project brief and planning documentation.

● 03 Scripts: 
Python notebooks used for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

● 04 Analysis:
Contains visual outputs and commentary used to surface insights and answer business questions.

● 05 Sent to Client:
Final presentation materials prepared for stakeholder review.

Note: The 02 Data folder was part of the original project structure but is not included in this repository, per course instructions. All analysis was performed using course provided datasets, which are excluded from GitHub due to size and licensing constraints.

## Code Overview
All code was written in Python and executed using Jupyter notebooks. The following libraries were used throughout the analysis:
● pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning

● numpy: Numerical operations and array handling

● os: File and directory handling

● matplotlib.pyplot: Static and interactive visualizations

● matplotlib.ticker.FuncFormatter: Custom axis formatting

● seaborn: Statistical data visualization

● scipy: Advanced mathematical functions
